            series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the
            story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from
            his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his
            village. The story is told in two parts - the first set in Naruto's
            pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on
            two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned
            Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award
            the following year, and Naruto (1997). Naruto was serialized in
            Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and
            released in tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes.
